ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

ABBA,As Good As New,/a/abba/as+good+as+new_20003033.html,"I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true

Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new

ABBA,Bang,/a/abba/bang_20598415.html,"Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much

Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum

You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang

ABBA,Burning My Bridges,/a/abba/burning+my+bridges_20003011.html,"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra

ABBA,Chiquitita,/a/abba/chiquitita_20002978.html,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

ABBA,Crazy World,/a/abba/crazy+world_20003013.html,"I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world

But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame

Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please

I have questions and they know everything  
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

ABBA,Fernando,/a/abba/fernando_20002896.html,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...

Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.

Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

ABBA,From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel,/a/abba/from+a+twinkling+star+to+a+passing+angel_21001358.html,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays

Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast  
  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine

One among the others, nothing much to say  
Plain and simple girl  
Not a special type in any way  
Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
It's an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
And thinking that he'll never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
It's so much more than any words can say  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street

A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
And you feel a strange attraction  
The air is vibrant and electrified  
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice

People come and take their chances  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot

The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

No poet has ever painted  
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me  
Yes, I let the music speak  
I let the music speak

Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice

Smoking was my only vice  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me

A little smalltalk, a smile  
And baby I was stuck  
I still don't know what  
You've done with me  
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and  
They've been pretty scarce  
I used to think that was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me

Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room

I took her home and  
That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through  
And she was always in my heart

And tomorrow there will be another day

When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Early that fall  
I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day

You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree  
'Cause I know she's got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So she's back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost never-ending stream  
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think she's a bore  
But they wouldn't know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for

He said, I'm a minister  
A big shot in the state?  
I said I just can't  
Believe it, boy  
I think it's great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong?  
He said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that I'm a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said, who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
What's our situation do  
We have some time for us?  
I said, I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said, if you're going  
Somewhere can I come along?  
I said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all

I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

The feeling right, the Paris night  
Did it's best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now you're working in a bank  
The family man, the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams

Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain

High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry

Frida High and mighty, his banner flies

Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here no-one can harm me  
They just stare at me and wonder why  
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near  
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here, among my coconuts  
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got  
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window  
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
No-one else but you can calm me  
You should know by now I'm far too proud  
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too  
You shouldn't treat me like you always do  
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down

Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
And I have to sit down for a while  
The feeling that I'm losing her forever  
And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time  
(Slipping through my fingers)  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

Some folks only see the litter

And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning

And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two

I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came

We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
  
And we dance beneath the moon

"
ABBA,The Visitors,/a/abba/the+visitors_20002864.html,"I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
I cannot move, I'm standing  
Numb and frozen  
Among the things I love so dearly  
The books, the paintings and the furniture  
Help me  
  
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
And they don't dare to come here  
Anymore now  
But how I loved our secret meetings  
We talked and talked in quiet voices  
Smiling  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
And now they've come to take me  
Come to break me  
And yet it isn't unexpected  
I have been waiting for these visitors  
Help me  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror ever growing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up
