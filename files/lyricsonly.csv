ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

ABBA,As Good As New,/a/abba/as+good+as+new_20003033.html,"I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true

Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new

ABBA,Bang,/a/abba/bang_20598415.html,"Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much

Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum

You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang

ABBA,Burning My Bridges,/a/abba/burning+my+bridges_20003011.html,"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra

ABBA,Chiquitita,/a/abba/chiquitita_20002978.html,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

ABBA,Crazy World,/a/abba/crazy+world_20003013.html,"I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world

But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame

Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please

I have questions and they know everything  
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

ABBA,Fernando,/a/abba/fernando_20002896.html,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...

Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.

Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

ABBA,From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel,/a/abba/from+a+twinkling+star+to+a+passing+angel_21001358.html,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays

Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast  
  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine

One among the others, nothing much to say  
Plain and simple girl  
Not a special type in any way  
Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
It's an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
And thinking that he'll never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
It's so much more than any words can say  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street

A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
And you feel a strange attraction  
The air is vibrant and electrified  
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice

People come and take their chances  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot

The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

No poet has ever painted  
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me  
Yes, I let the music speak  
I let the music speak

Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice

Smoking was my only vice  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me

A little smalltalk, a smile  
And baby I was stuck  
I still don't know what  
You've done with me  
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and  
They've been pretty scarce  
I used to think that was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me

Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room

I took her home and  
That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through  
And she was always in my heart

And tomorrow there will be another day

When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Early that fall  
I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day

You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree  
'Cause I know she's got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So she's back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost never-ending stream  
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think she's a bore  
But they wouldn't know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for

He said, I'm a minister  
A big shot in the state?  
I said I just can't  
Believe it, boy  
I think it's great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong?  
He said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that I'm a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said, who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
What's our situation do  
We have some time for us?  
I said, I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said, if you're going  
Somewhere can I come along?  
I said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all

I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

The feeling right, the Paris night  
Did it's best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now you're working in a bank  
The family man, the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams

Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain

High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry

Frida High and mighty, his banner flies

Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here no-one can harm me  
They just stare at me and wonder why  
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near  
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here, among my coconuts  
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got  
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window  
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
No-one else but you can calm me  
You should know by now I'm far too proud  
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too  
You shouldn't treat me like you always do  
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down

Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
And I have to sit down for a while  
The feeling that I'm losing her forever  
And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time  
(Slipping through my fingers)  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

Some folks only see the litter

And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning

And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two

I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came

ABBA,The Visitors,/a/abba/the+visitors_20002864.html,"I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
I cannot move, I'm standing  
Numb and frozen  
Among the things I love so dearly  
The books, the paintings and the furniture  
Help me  
  
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
And they don't dare to come here  
Anymore now  
But how I loved our secret meetings  
We talked and talked in quiet voices  
Smiling  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
And now they've come to take me  
Come to break me  
And yet it isn't unexpected  
I have been waiting for these visitors  
Help me  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door

Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear

It's simple and it's plain  
Why should I complain.

Like I used to kiss you?  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name?  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed  
  
The judges will decide  
The likes of me abide  
Spectators of the show  
Always staying low

A lover or a friend  
A big thing or a small

And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  
But you see  
The winner takes it all  
The winner takes it all

When something special he read

Wouldn't let myself believe

That secret part of me  
Until we kissed an made it open up so easily

I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
Everything that you give in to  
Everything you'll ever need  
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
You gotta know  
But more importantly  
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy

We should let love come naturally  
And sometimes I don't know  
Just what you really do to me  
That is O.K.  
'cause it's all part of the mystery

Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever

Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
It was something about their hearts, you used to break  
Them, and make them go down on their knees  
On and on again  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they  
Were a single pair, not free like you  
Still they got a tragical end  
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Passion changes but they will still remember you  
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today

So proud to be the one  
Who brought you this way  
I love you with all my heart  
And my love is here to stay  
But I can't help worrying  
Will you eventually smoke weed?  
  
Soon enough you'll be walking  
You and me hand in hand  
The silly words you'll be talkin'  
Only daddy can understand  
We'll go out making snowmen  
Building castles in the sand  
And all the time I'm thinking,  
Will this kid end up smokin' weed?  
  
But time keeps on going  
And you keep on growin'  
You're now six years old  
You're getting so good at your spellin'  
But my mind is always dwellin'  
On the fact that you  
Could be the kind of guy  
Who grows up and needs  
To smoke weed on the couch  
All the time  
All the time  
  
So answer me this while  
You're lying in your little bed  
Why must you insist on bein'  
Such a fuckin' pothead?  
There's other things in life  
That can make you feel good  
But you just keep on smokin' your herb  
You can't get enough of  
Your precious, precious reefer  
Where you getting all this money  
To buy so much Hawaiian dope?

You said I'm crazy,  
If I am I'm crazy for you.  
  
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
Turns me crazy,  
But it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible  
You drift into my head  
And turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
Tell me to run and I'll race,  
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,  
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
And make me crazy for you.  
Crazy for you.  
  
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.  
I wish you'd come over,  
Send me spinning closer to you.  
  
My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
But the more I do,  
The crazier I turn into.  
  
Pacing floors and opening doors,  
Hoping you'll walk through  
And save me boy,  
Because I'm too crazy for you.  
Crazy for you

And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl

A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back, oh

At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
It's no secret  
That the both of us are running out of time

Aerosmith,Blind Man,/a/aerosmith/blind+man_20004145.html,"I took a course in hallelujah  
I went to night school for the blues  
I took some stuff they said would cool ya  
But nothing seemed to light my fuse  
But it's all in the past  
Like a check that's in the mail  
She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
I'm gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
I've had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heaven's turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
We'll be saving us a little money  
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why  
Don't make no sense lightin' candles  
There's too much moonlight in our eyes  
Because here comes the sun  
Ain't no surprise  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Gonna open up your eyes

An Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor  
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store  
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me

Know where to draw the line

Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got to choose  
Where to draw the line

Aerosmith,Eat The Rich,/a/aerosmith/eat+the+rich_20004281.html,"Well I woke up this morning  
On the wrong side of the bed  
And how I got to thinkin'  
About all those things you said  
About ordinary people  
And how they make you sick  
And if callin' names kicks back on you  
Then I hope this does the trick  
'cause I'm sick of your complainin'  
About how many bills  
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'  
'Bout your poodles and your pills  
And I just can't see no humor  
About your way of life  
And I think I can do more for you  
With this here fork and knife

Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
So I called up my head shrinker  
And I told him what I'd done  
He said you best go on a diet  
Yeah, I hope you have some fun  
And a don't go burst the bubble  
On rich folks who get rude  
'Cause you won't get in no trouble  
When you eats that kinda food  
Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds  
And then they go get stiff  
And they're dancin' in the yacht club  
With muff and uncle biff  
But there's one good thing that happens  
When you toss your pearls to swine  
Their attitudes may taste like shit  
But go real good with wine  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Believe in all the good things  
That money just can't buy  
Then you won't get no bellyache  
From eatin' humble pie  
I believe in rags to riches  
Your inheritance won't last  
So take your gray poupon my friend  
And shove it up your ass  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more

Don't stop me now, I'm goin' crazy

God only knows I tried believin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
The first time you look for love  
You find you don't know jack... yeah  
So much for mind games you play to win  
'Cuz first you lose your heart's desire  
Then you get it back  
But ignorance ain't bliss  
There's so much more behind the kiss...I'm feelin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me  
God help the person...fff...who needs me...yeaah  
If ignorance is bliss then take me off the list  
I'm leaving  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their hearts and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies

The buildings were dead and the alleys  
Stunk from things that used to live there  
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered  
  
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his  
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence  
With not a scrap left on the plate  
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable  
Cause the only thing left was their faith  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do  
About it....

There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
There's a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....  
  
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
Made me wonder just who was the foe  
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus  
Had predicted such a long long time ago?  
You could hear screams and moanin'  
From the people atoning  
For their sins of a guilt ridden life  
And the final door shuts  
From the wind that leaves cuts  
From the edge on the blade of God's knife  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....  
  
There's a Melt Down in the Sky  
There's a new day comin and I don't know why  
There's a tear stuck in my eye  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why

Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried  
How they tried, open eyed, genocide  
Then... She died

I don't care what they say  
Time's too short  
The fire's too hot  
Don't know what to do  
'Cause I know in a flash  
It's just a memory too  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When we're apart my days are dark  
When I'm with you I'm in the light  
  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
  
I think I'll die  
I just can't wait  
  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
Aah till our next oasis in the night  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
You're my oasis in the night

Air Supply,A Little Bit More,/a/air+supply/a+little+bit+more_21058162.html,"For certain she was the face of springtime,  
The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away having me all black and blue.

Where we walk tall, or in disgrace  
Who tills the ground on which we tread  
Who gives us all our daily bread  
The spirit woken from its sleep  
The demon stirring from the deep  
Whose gates at dawn we all must pass  
The last one first, the first one last  
Whose words must be both black and white  
Whose music shall be day and night  
The moon that tells us of the sun  
Where voices soar so far above

If life was meant to be a choice  
For either happiness or greed  
If you can't walk, you'll always run  
Away from anyone, yes you will  
  
But if we learn to take our time  
As though each moment is a treasure

When you are free, then suddenly  
There's room for everyone, yes there is

And send our weary eyes to sleep

There's nothing you should fear  
Just come to me

If someone needs you more than me, I will understand why  
I'd never stand between someone who's holding your heart  
But I can't let a superstition tear us apart  
Who has the right to speak fire from above  
If heaven is away from you, that is the place I will give up  
For falling in love can't be taking these lips from the cup  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I'm not afraid to face the truth of what I believe  
If love was never meant to choose, it could never succeed  
And we may always stand alone in everyone's sight  
And be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right  
Who puts a price on eternity's sin  
Who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again  
For you are the reason that pleasure was taken from the pain  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I won't see you cry, should it make you cry  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood

I say there is no reason for my fear  
Cause I feel so secure when we're together  
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear

Come crashing through your door

I've been running around in circles in my mind  
Baby it always seems that I'm following you

When I turn away  
She knows those are the times  
There's nothing she can say  
  
Nothing that anyone can do  
And so she lets me live it through  
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty  
She just simply lets me be  
And goes right on loving me

Have all slipped through my fingers  
When they just can't be found

Air Supply,Crazy Love,/a/air+supply/crazy+love_20522279.html,"When you are young, the thought of the day is  
Kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules.  
You laugh all the way, and grow up so fast that  
Everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last.  
And you smile as it's going past.  
Each morning arrives, and so much is new  
You can't wait to share it all with someone just like you.  
The telephone rings, and friends come around and talk to the night  
You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love  
  
You live every day, as fast as it comes  
And don't count the cost because, there is no other way.  
These times will change, and people must grow but  
Until you do, you live the only life that you know  
And the wild fire lets you go.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes,  
Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew  
At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love

Saturdays, girls  
I was never in love, never had the time  
In my hustle and hurried world  
Laughing my self to sleep, waking up lonely  
I need someone to hold me, oh  
  
It's such a crazy home town  
It can drag you down  
Till you run out of dreams  
So you party all night to the music and lights  
But you don't what happiness means  
I was dancing in the dark with strangers  
No love around me  
When suddenly you found me, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're everything I need, you're everything to me  
Oh girl  
  
Everything good, everything fine  
That's what you are  
So put your hand in mine and together we'll climb  
As high as the highest star  
I'm living the life time in every minute  
That we're together  
And I'm staying right here forever, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality

Evidence of love

Show me some evidence of love

There's only so much I can do  
And it doesn't make sense  
Without some evidence of love  
  
There's a frozen look on your face  
Is it saying goodbye  
'Cause there's nothing as cold as the ashes  
When the fire has died  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some...

Stand and fight  
Gotta say what's on your mind, baby  
So much is on the line

Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now

Came the holy power,  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land  
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen  
The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find  
(chorus)  
It is the roar of the wind,  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see

Our love, has brought us both together  
And it's our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before it's time

It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,  
You'll remember it all

I don't know how far we are meant to go,  
If you tell me so that is where I want to be.  
(CHORUS)  
If I give it all, if I give it all away.  
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.  
I should have said what I was thinking  
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
I'll give my love to you.

In the winter when it's raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
All those days of endless waiting

When thunder breaks the dawn  
When all muy strength is gone  
When shadows disappear  
I'll still be holding on

We touch and feel, to hurt or heal  
And in the end  
  
We run so far from who we really are  
And we starve and thirst, we praise and curse  
And I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
  
We shout and scream, but it's just a silly dream  
And we hold it inside like its live or die  
Till in the end we learn to wait  
And we squeeze the hands of fate  
And we twist and turn  
We freeze and burn, but I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
Through the time and space  
I'll always see your face  
And if I must count every star

Well at least I had last night  
Now I know how the feeling grows  
Cause you made me come alive

Waiting for the moment when I'll feel you near

I just smile and touched your hair  
As you went out

I like the floor all the power in my hand  
Driving up and down the road all day  
Overtaking anything in the way  
Alongside us came a man in a grin  
Winding down the window clever again  
You know manual is far too old  
To keep pace then he left us cold  
  
It's automatic, it's automatic  
It's automatic, it goes by itself  
  
  
Quick thinking and a mutual aim  
So on finding out the name of the game  
A different unit was ordered that day  
Who wants to go thru' the gears anyway  
The same color the same design  
The same car with a different mind  
Knowing now we wouldn't take second place  
Both saying with a smile on our face.

Then a foolish heart can still be true

And it's nice, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.

In the ragged morning then the word came alive in you

Standing on my doorstep  
Not very old looking so helpless  
And looking so cold

Talking about just the things we knew  
Watching a new day arise outside my room

And in fascination my heart was sold  
Weaving in and out of my mind  
With a skidder off now

And now I'm so alive  
I'm comin' through  
They're teaching me to tell it to you  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee  
  
Oh your hearts would say  
My mind is gone  
And ran away  
But who's the loser if you don't know  
What I have  
A job that's hard to beat  
Looking out for holey feet  
Treading softly on the ground  
Making waves but not a sound  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee

Air Supply,Mother Said,/a/air+supply/mother+said_20004840.html,"Mother said, don't leave me  
There are monsters at the door  
I put on all my armour  
But I couldn't find my sword  
But there'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
If they come to take you prisoner  
I'll be there to set you free  
  
Mother said, I'm grown up  
In a Sunday shirt and tie  
As long as I can see you  
Can I hold you when I cry  
There'll always be tomorrow  
I'll be so big and strong  
I'll sleep with all the lights out  
Not afraid of anyone  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
Mother said she's sleeping  
So I climbed back into bed  
But the monsters took her prisoner  
That's all that father said  
So I thought about tomorrow  
And I learned to be alone  
Making friends with shadows  
As they moved around my home  
  
Mother never leaves me  
I can always see her smile  
  
I sit here in the evening  
To talk to her awhile  
There'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
I know that any moment  
She will come to set me free  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you

If ever you miss me or when you  
Start thinking about  
All the nights that we shared  
Darling, you know Ill be there

Speaking into the air  
Where can I find the life  
I know that only dreams can share  
I close my eyes and see you there  
Calling me far beyond  
Wrapped in a robe of mystery  
You wave your magic wand  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart  
  
Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone  
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home  
I stare through a veil, so thin yet so near  
And walk in your footsteps, as you  
Cast off my fear  
  
Walk with me through the gates of time, to eternity  
And our love, will never fade away  
  
We can fly to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  
Walking along the boulevard  
Wishing we were complete  
Why are some things so very hard to witness and believe  
  
The victor of this universe  
The victim of the wind  
Where does a dream begin and end  
And where does life begin  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart

I never new how much there was  
To lose and gain  
But when the sun was taken  
You never shone so bright  
And from a place we'd long forgotten  
The blind were given sight  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you to  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of

If the dawn should break and you're  
Far away  
Can you ever know what I need to say  
I can see how much I was taking it all  
For granted  
Among the silent victims  
Only the wind would moan  
And for a time I felt us touch  
The great unknown  
For that eternal moment  
Oh what a price to pay  
With nothing left but all we have  
We slowly walked away  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you too  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of

And cast your heart beyond those

Destiny unknown  
Leads you to the promised land  
Or leaves you head in hand  
Tears fall like rain  
Coming down once again  
Stranger lost in a distant land  
Language hard to understand  
Seems like years have slipped away  
Still have so much left to say  
And I can't wait to see you  
(Chorus) When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
Now's the time to turn away  
From the ghost of yesterday  
When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
I'll be the one to shelter you  
The spirit of love will guide us through  
Love, right or wrong,  
Somehow we must carry on  
If only words were spoken true  
If only I could trust in you  
To believe in the dream of what could be  
Hidden clues to the mystery  
It's time to set yourself free  
(Chorus)  
Let the spirit of love come to you  
Let the spirit of love come to you

Shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven  
You know what you've found, you want to last forever  
You heart has found its wings and left for never never  
  
And then I lose control

Of my very best friends

Just like your love that never ends  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success

Then why can't I paint you  
The words will never show  
The you I've come to know  
  
If a face could launch a thousand ships  
Then where am I to go  
There's no one home but you  
You're all that's left me too  
  
And when my love  
For life is running dry  
You'll come and pour yourself on me  
  
If a man could be two places  
At one time I'd be with you  
Tomorrow and today  
Beside you all the way  
  
If the world should start revolving  
Spinning slowly down to die  
I'd spend the end with you  
And when the world was through  
  
Then one by one  
The stars would all go out  
Then you and I would simply fly away

Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin

I feel the warmth of his hand in mine  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
After a while we run under a tree  
I turn to him and he kisses me  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly he breathes and I close my eyes  
Sharing our love under stormy skies

And here you are by my side

Turned night into day  
I need you to stay.

He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while

And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
I knew I caught a glimpse of heaven love  
As he thanked me and ran out  
I knew that god had sent that little boy to remind me  
What Christmas is all about

Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning  
To listen to the clear ringing bells  
It's tones so sweetly are calling  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There she sleeps close by the church in the valley  
Lies one that I love so well  
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath the willow  
Disturb not her rest in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There close by the site of that loved one  
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom  
When farewell hymns shall be chanted  
I shall rest by her side in the tomb  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood

She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear

And hung-up the telephone

It was me she was telling good-bye

Give me the chance to tell her I still care  
Get her back on the line, tell her I'm still in love  
Said, ""sorry son, but you're breaking up""

Summer nights he was gone me and mama stayed home

On laidback Sunday afternoons  
They said them young folks sure got a hard road  
Oh, they're growin' up too soon  
  
Now I know they were right, and as I sit here tonight

Been all over the country,  
Started my share of new flames  
But after all is said and done,  
there's only one that remains

Dixie fire it never leaves me whole  
It took a hometown girl to show me  
How cruel these hot summer nights can be  
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me  
Burning in the heart of me  
  
Searching for some kind of direction,  
Looking for a guiding light  
Needed to see a lighthouse,  
Like a ship on a stormy night  
Somehow you heard my music,  
You felt the sadness in me  
You took the words that were so cold,  
And added a warm melody

Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin', a-just to send it on down the line

In the city streets and the quiet country towns  
Working together like spokes inside a wheel  
They keep this country turning around

Or the one out in the warehouse, bringing in the load  
Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol  
For everyone who works behind the scenes  
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine  
Hello America let me thank you for your time

He was at his best when the going was rough  
He made a living for the family and never had to cheat

We sat down at the table and thanked god in prayer  
Cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
We had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat  
We had food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We picked the cotton and gathered the corn  
We were taught to work from the day we were born  
Mom and dad and all us children worked in the summer's heat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
When you sit down at the table thank god in prayer

If you've got patches on your britches just be sure to keep em neat

Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,  
And learnin' how to give it all we had.  
  
As Life went on and years went by,  
I saw the light in daddy's eye,  
And felt the love in mamma's hands,  
They kept us warm and kept us fed,  
Taught us how to look ahead,  
Now lookin' back I understand.

Those fertile fields are never far away,

And how it impressed me then,  
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

We won't be disturbed, the phone's off the hook  
And when it comes to lovin' woman, you wrote the book  
And I just saw that 'I want you' look and that's all it took, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Well, the boys at the plant are punching the clock  
If they could see us darlin', oh, what a shock  
They'd do the same if they had what I got  
So please don't stop, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today

Alabama,I Love You Enough To Let You Go,/a/alabama/i+love+you+enough+to+let+you+go_20250544.html,"I've rehearsed this day a thousand times  
I've played this scene out in my mind  
You spread your wings, you need to fly  
It breaks my heart to say goodbye  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go  
  
My mind goes back to memories  
Of pony rides upon my knee  
First day of school, your brand new bike  
And football games on Friday nights  
And through the years I've watched you grow  
And I love you enough to let you go  
  
Don't look back when you drive away  
I don't want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
You've never seen your daddy cry  
  
So many things I want to say  
You'll meet new friends, you'll be okay  
I'll pray for you out on your own  
But don't forget your way back home  
And though I may not let it show  
I love you enough to let you go  
  
Don't look back when you drive away  
I don't want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
You've never seen your daddy cry  
  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go

Turn on my table lamp and here I go again  
It's time to write a letter, I'm in the mood tonight  
Gotta find a way to tell you how I feel inside  
  
So I write a little,  
And I cry a little  
It's so hard to find a way  
To say goodbye a little  
But somewhere in the middle  
My emotions interfere  
So I write it a little,  
And cry a little tear  
And I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
  
God I miss you  
Can't be with you  
I would kiss you oh so good  
'Cause you're my only cure for lonely  
I'd call if I could  
  
Well I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
Wishing you were here  
Well I'm writing a little,  
And wishing you were here  
And I write a little,  
And I cry a little tear

And wishing you were here

You hold the Queen of Hearts  
And if you gamble on a diamond win  
The dealin' starts  
  
You stand to lose it all  
As the cards begin to fall  
And the lesson learned is hard  
You're only dealt the Queen of Cards  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
  
Once upon a lifetime  
You know that you've been blessed  
When you hold your first born tenderly against your chest  
  
And through the innocence you see  
The value of a family  
And you feel a special bond  
That only comes along  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
And people only find love like yours and mine  
Once upon a lifetime

Like the water from our sink  
They say's not safe to drink  
  
You gotta go and buy it at the store  
Now we're told there's a hole in the ozone  
Look what's washing on the beach  
And Lord, I believe, from the heavens to the seas  
We're bringing Mother Nature to her knees

So let's leave some blue up above us  
Let's leave some green on the ground  
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow  
Leave it and pass it on down  
  
Well there's a change taking place way on the mountains  
Acid rain is falling on the leaves  
And down in Brazil, the fires are burning still  
How we gonna breathe without them trees

There's a place where I live called the Canyon  
Where Daddy taught me to swim  
And that water, it's so pure  
And I'm gonna make sure  
Daddy's grandkids can swim there like him  
  
Now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty  
When we look into the eyes of our kids  
'Cause brothers it's a fact, if we take and don't put back  
They'll have to pay for all we did

Precious memories, unseen angels  
Sent from somewhere to my soul  
How they linger ever near me  
And the sacred past unfolds  
  
Precious father and loving mother  
Fly across the lonely years  
And old home scenes of my childhood  
In fond memories appear  
  
As I travel on life's pathway  
Know not what the years may hold  
As I ponder, hope grows fonder  
Precious memories flood my soul  
  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Echo's from the past I hear  
Old time singing, gladness bringing  
From that lovely land somewhere  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold

From being little more than just a southern state

I played for tip and watered drinks  
Just a novice in a business  
That's seldom what it seems

And B.V. left for Malibu

When the boys touched the nation, unaware at the time  
I got to go to Texas, California, New York too  
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin' in his shoes  
  
But in the Bowery hangs the memories  
Of dreams that still come true  
Every time I see the spotlights  
I'm one of the chosen few

About the music that you make?

You don't fool me with your tinted eyes and make-up  
The firebird hides in shadow when you wake up  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
You don't fool me with your easy lies and fables  
You won't see me in ten buck furs and sables  
You sparkle like a snake  
The wine is real but the glass if fake  
Blame it on the apple tree but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do

While the master was riding the servants decided to play  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
While the sorcerer slept the apprentice decided to play  
While the master was hiding the servants decided to play  
Might be too much sun or too much of something in the air  
Whatever's happening nobody else is aware  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay

Alan Parsons Project,Mr. Time,/a/alan+parsons+project/mr+time_20522100.html,"Stealing a moment from Mr. Time  
He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime  
But it's all for show, all for show.  
Wearing your name and a number or two  
When the minute's up, so are you  
But everybody knows, everybody knows.  
Watching the hour from the light in his eyes,  
He waits for your soul to come in from the sky  
But it's lost below, lost below.  
Turning the Wheel of your destiny round,  
When the motion stops no more sound,  
Does anybody care, anybody care.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
See the truth, hear the lies,  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
Is it a feeling of deja vu?  
When he points his finger calling you  
Is it illusion? Just an illusion  
Picking up seconds that fall to his feet  
He blows them away as rocks on his seat,  
Cool as his smile, his smile.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,  
When Mr. Time has come for you  
See the truth, hear the lies,  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.

We say welcome to the mission  
Show us all what you can do  
We need a man with vision  
So we put our trust in you  
And now we hope sincerely  
That you'll do the best that you can do  
  
Oh for sure it won't be easy  
And we will have to risk our lives  
Some will try to break us  
And cut us down to size  
But jsut remember  
There can be no consolation prize  
Not in our eyes  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
Can you hear what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
Although time is getting short  
There's still some sand left in the glass  
And now we have a living breathing  
Rocket man at last  
It's time to take a step  
And nail our colours to the mast  
  
No more talk of great adventures  
When it's movement that we need  
It must be our intention  
That we never loose the lead  
So count us down to zero  
And let's get up to speed  
We're up and away  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
So believe what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
And so now they cry for justice  
As if justice will be done  
But the eye up in the sky  
Was flying to close to the sun  
The challenger has fallen  
And the race has now been run....

Alan Parsons Project,Somebody Out There,/a/alan+parsons+project/somebody+out+there_20005427.html,"Maybe I'm imagining the things they say about me  
Maybe there is really nothing there at all  
Standing in the middle while the rumours fly around me  
Hiding from a shadow on an empty wall  
  
When my back is turned he's up to something else  
And I must not stop believing in myself  
Am I dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, talks like you do  
He calls up your number  
And you can't get through somebody out there  
  
Wish that I could run away and leave it all behind me  
Wish I wasn't hurt by all the things they say  
If I didn't need to know the simple truth about me  
Wouldn't it be easier to walk away  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, using your name  
Somebody out there, you get the blame  
There's doubt and suspicion  
It's hard to explain somebody out there  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, stolen your base  
Somebody out there, parked in your space  
You've no reservation, he's taken your place  
Somebody out there, wasting your time  
Somebody out there, using your dime  
Your friends think you're crazy  
They're way out of line  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, thinks like you do  
You stare at the mirror  
You're looking into  
Somebody out there

Ask yourself a question now there's a multiple choice  
""You've only one shot, get it right"", says a distance voice  
Don't get your head into a spin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye  
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know there is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run  
  
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground  
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found  
But watch your step the ice is thin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one  
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done  
It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know it is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come

I'll have revenge upon Fortunato  
Smile in his face I'll say ""come let us go  
I've a cask of Amontillado""  
  
Sheltered inside from the cold of the snow  
Follow me now to the vault down below  
Drinking the wine as we laugh at the time  
Which is passing incredibly slow  
  
(What are these chains that are binding my arm?)  
Part of you dies each passing day  
(Say it's a game and I'll come to no harm)  
You'll feel your life slipping away  
  
You who are rich and whose troubles are few  
May come around to see my point of view  
What price the Crown of a King on his throne  
When you're chained in the dark all alone  
  
(Spare me my life only name your reward)  
Part of you dies each brick I lay  
(Bring back some light in the name of the Lord)  
You'll feel your mind slipping away

Then another would take my place  
For the chance to behold your face  
  
As the days of my life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
At the call of the wind's command  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
  
All that I ask you  
Is, show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
  
As the sun turns slowly around the sky  
Till the shadow of night is high  
The eagle will learn to fly  
  
As the days of his life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
And vanish upon the land  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
Show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
And so, with no warning, no last goodbye  
In the dawn of the morning sky  
The eagle will rise again

Alan Parsons Project,The Fall Of The House Of Usher - I Prelude,/a/alan+parsons+project/the+fall+of+the+house+of+usher+i+prelude_20702854.html,"[instrumental]  
  
(I) Prelude  
  
""Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined  
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.  
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes  
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless.""

Alan Parsons Project,The Raven,/a/alan+parsons+project/the+raven_20005383.html,"The clock struck midnight  
And through my sleeping  
I heard a tapping at my door  
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness  
And so I turned inside once more  
To my amazement  
There stood a raven  
Whose shadow hung above my door  
Then through the silence  
It spoke that one word  
That I shall hear forever more  
Nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore  
And still the raven remains in my room  
No matter how much I implore  
No words can soothe him  
No prayer remove him  
And I must hear for evermore  
Quoth the raven, nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven  
Nevermore

So many eyes are made of ice

One more substitute I won't be trying  
One more piece of the rock that I'm not buying  
So many times we stand and fight  
So many reasons can't be right  
One more simple truth I'm not denying  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many fools who don't think twice  
Too many ways to pay the price  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world  
  
One more sacrifice I won't be making  
One more golden rule I won't be breaking  
No one to let me state my case  
No one to tell me to my face  
One more sweet suprise I won't be faking  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many bridges you can burn  
Too many tables you can't turn  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world

Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many games that I can't play  
Too many windmills in my way

Round your finger  
Token of the love we give one another  
Music of the future that we'll discover  
Promises to keep more than any other  
Symbolising all that we share  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for everyone to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
In a circle  
Living in a world of perpetual motion  
Turning with the tide of a restless ocean  
Spinning on the wheel of your own emotion  
Ridin on a wild carrousel  
You'll be turning round and round  
Round and round we go  
  
Promises, promises, promises, promises  
  
Round your finger  
After all the years we've been together  
Walking in the sun and stormy weather  
Sharing in a moment to last forever  
Memories and dreams without end  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
And it finds you in the darkness of the night  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it guides you when you're blinded by the light  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for all to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
The ring is magic, magic, fire, fire  
The ring is mine

Taking my life  
One day at a time

Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
I'll get through the night on my own  
Tell me what to do  
Now there's nobody watching over me  
If I seem to be calm  
Well it's all an illusion  
Tell me what to do  
When the fear of the night comes over me  
There's a smile on my face  
Just to hide the confusion  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I can't think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you

Louder and louder  
Till I could tell the sound was not within my ears  
You should have seen me  
You would have seen my eyes grow white and cold with fear  
  
Heard all the things in Heaven and Earth  
I've seen many things in Hell  
But his vulture's eye of a cold pale blue  
Is the eye of the Devil himself  
  
Take me away now

What earthly reason holding sway  
There is no heaven at all

While some may rise  
And some may fall

And we follow like sheep  
We thread the path  
That leads to thee  
We seek the soul that is not ours to keep  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go i

Time, beckoning me

Keeps flowing like a river  
To the sea  
  
Goodbye my love,  
Maybe for forever  
Goodbye my love,  
The tide waits for me  
Who knows when we shall meet again  
If ever

Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)  
To the sea, to the sea  
  
Till it's gone forever  
Gone forever  
Gone forevermore

Alan Parsons Project,We Play The Game,/a/alan+parsons+project/we+play+the+game_20522095.html,"Featuring The Crystal Method  
Music Written By Alan Parsons, Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland  
Lyrics by Alan Parsons  
  
You drink the wine  
You play the fool  
You cross the line  
You lose your cool  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
You raise the bar  
Lost in a trance  
One bridge too far  
No second chance  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone  
  
You had a dream  
You cast the dice  
Your shady scheme  
You paid the price  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
With hearts of stone  
You lose again  
You're on your own  
  
A turning tide  
A streak of light  
Arms open wide  
The end's in sight  
And someone cares  
Yes someone cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone

Where there is injury, Your pardon Lord,  
And where there's doubt, true faith in You  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,  
Where there is darkness, let me bring light,  
And where there's sadness, bring Your joy

So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,

For when we give, we will ourselves receive  
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned  
And in dying that we gain eternal life  
And in dying that we gain eternal life

We're floating in the moonlit sky  
The people far below are sleeping as we fly  
  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding in the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Far across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below believes their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low  
On an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
  
And walking in the air  
We're dancing in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're walking in the air

Alice Cooper,Apple Bush,/a/alice+cooper/apple+bush_20294415.html,"But over in a land that's in my back yard  
There's a people who succeed, they don't try hard  
  
Well, they found a way to live with ease  
By eating from the bush instead of the trees  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Path to eternity  
Find you a path and you follow the call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Well, over in a corner, standing there  
Telling my house that they haven't a single care  
  
But my house does not listen (worry) it's got a path of it's own  
Yet the bush, and a tree, never leave it alone  
  
Apple Bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Find you a path and you buy with a call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Someday like my house you're going to chose too  
If you cut this new path well the old one will do  
and you live with the people who live with ease  
The red apple bush, the blue apple tree

He's been gone for so long.  
Do you think he'll ever come home?  
  
I was gone for fourteen days  
I coulda been gone for more  
Held up in the intensive care ward  
Lyin' on the floor  
I was gone for all those days  
But I, was not all alone  
I made friends with a lot of people  
In the danger zone  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it every day  
See my lonely mind explode  
Since I've gone away  
  
I think I lost some weight there  
And I, I'm sure I need some rest  
Sleepin don't come very easy  
In a straight white vest  
Should like to see that little children  
She's only four years old.. old  
I'd give her back all of her play things  
Even, even the ones I stole  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone insane  
  
I want to get out of here  
I want to get out of here  
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere  
Ya gotta let me out of here  
Let me outta her  
Etc  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
Blown up in my face  
  
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat  
And I, I ran into the street  
I saw a man that was choking there  
I guess he couldn't breathe  
Said to myself this is very strange  
I'm glad it wasn't me  
But now I hear those sirens callin'  
And so I am not free  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
(I didn't want to be)  
I see it every day  
(Leave me alone  
I didn't want to be  
Don't touch me!)  
See my lonely mind explode

Well I don't know her  
But with a magnifying glance  
I just sorta look her over  
  
We have a drink or two, well maybe three  
And then suddenly, she starts telling me her life story  
  
She says  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home  
Cause it's a long long way to paradise  
And I'm still on my own.  
  
Told her that I came from Detroit City  
And I played guitar in a long haired rock and roll band  
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice  
I said 'listen baby, you really wouldn't understand'  
  
And I said

On my own,

Cause it's a long, long way, to paradise,

Lost in the radio, drive another mile

Tired of serious conversation  
Tangled up in situations  
I feel so free 'cause you want nothing from me  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile

Two pressure-cookers go insane

Alice Cooper,Disgraceland,/a/alice+cooper/disgraceland_20181650.html,"I want to tell you a story, happened long ago  
About a redneck boy down from Tupelo  
I got the slick black hair, I played a rock guitar  
I liked to shake my hips, man, then i went too far  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
I had a lot of girls, yeah, I had a lot of guns  
When they found me dead, ow, the whole world was stunned  
Went to the pearly gates, said, ""I'm the hippest thing""  
And Peter said ""Well son, we already got ourselves a king""  
  
He lived on southern deep-fried spam,  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
He finished his short life sweaty and bloated and stoned  
(A-Hey-Hey)  
He ruled his domain and he died on the throne  
No ""Yes-Men"", no colonel, he went all alone...  
  
(Hey, man, that looks like me down there on the floor)  
  
I heard the devil cry real loud and clear  
""You were the big man, there, hejust a sideman here  
Well, I know your face, and I've heard your name  
Looks like heaven's loss, gonna be my gain""  
(I've got plans for you, man)

Let me tell you  
I was so scared I couldn't move  
Like my boots were full of glue  
Then I felt a little tug  
And I thought of good Old Blue  
And he pulled me from that catastrophe  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
I'm alive  
  
I was spitting in the canyon  
Near the cliff up on the mountain  
When an unexpected sneeze  
Hung me in the breeze  
At forty five degrees in the sky  
Suddenly I felt something  
Had me by the belt  
And in between my praying  
Swore I heard a stallion neighing  
Was the ghost of my horse  
And I cried, yes I cried  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
Hey, I'm alive  
  
Things were getting gory  
Got caught on territory  
Belonging to the Crutches  
In an alley in their clutches  
Looking kind of dismal that night  
Well the leader's name was Fats  
Swinging broken baseball bats  
Things got really frantic  
Starting jumping in their panic  
Hallucinating billions of rats  
Lots of rats  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive, I'm alive, real alive  
  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
To save my life  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive  
He's alive, he's alive, he's alive  
I'm alive, yeah

I'm alive, real alive

I am the one who lives under your bed

Get down, back where you started  
Get down, back into hell  
Your black soul, you know you're black hearted  
I smell your sulfurous smell  
  
All of my things that I play with in daylight  
You turn into monsters at night  
My toys were my friends  
Until you taught them all how to bite  
  
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see  
You scared me with visions of fire  
You danced on my bed  
With the flames on your head dancing higher  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed

I don't want to follow you down to your place

at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup  
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out of my face

All I need is love and company  
Gentle river bring him back to me

Listen here I don't need your sympathy  
Cause I've made my life to live it  
All I need is you here with me...

Alison Krauss,Gravity,/a/alison+krauss/gravity_20521753.html,"I left home when I was seventeen  
I just grew tired of falling down  
And I'm sure I was told  
The allure of the road  
Would be all I found  
  
And all the answers that I started with  
Turned out questions in the end  
So years roll on by  
And just like the sky  
The road never ends  
  
And the people who love me still ask me  
When are you coming back to town  
And I answer quite frankly  
When they stop building roads  
And all God needs is gravity to hold me down

Here comes goodbye, tonight  
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right  
It comes as no surprise, this time

It was so wrong  
Almost at the same time

No one really knows  
But when the memories cling and take you there  
Till you no longer care  
You can let go now  
It's not right for me  
To cling to you  
Somehow I just needed time  
From what was to be  
It's not like me  
To hold somebody down  
But I was tossed high by love  
Almost never came down  
Only to land  
Where no love is found  
And I'm no longer bound  
I can let go now

Six feet underground

Would you come and look for me  
Or would you just let me sink  
Beneath the waves so blue  
  
What if I had learned to fly  
Fly all night till day drew nigh  
Touch down upon a branch and  
Scan the crowd for you  
  
When I touch my feet on the land  
I'll kiss your lips and take you in

My tongue is tied  
The moon is swaying back and forth  
Against the navy sky

My body is trembling on my knees  
Just have a little mercy on me  
Run away and hide  
  
When I sleep the angels sing  
But I cannot hear a thing  
Eyes close  
Dreaming of the better days gone by  
  
When I wake the trumpets play  
And I'm standing at the gates  
Fall down and joy  
I know my race has just been won  
  
When I was young my momma would say  
Well life is hard, but that's O.K.  
If you can make it through the day

He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights  
They remind him, of nights long ago,  
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley
marred,  
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to
his knees,  
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not
hold  
[Chorus:]  
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay  
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away  
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,  
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his
women's love  
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger
and fear  
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen
leaves  
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his
injured pride  
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not
hold

My life was steeped in sin but in love he took me in  
His blood washed away every stain  
  
I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
He made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart

Wear your heart upon your sleeve

Say there's nothing left to bind us  
Leaving love without a trace

You'd soon find out why your new love falls some day  
Why can't we burn this heartache down

And in my heart, in my mind,

Finds me here alone at the end of one more day.  
Skipping stones across the water.  
Wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Palm trees sway in the evening breeze.  
Sing a lullabye of sweet love to me.  
Sailboat, sail away into the amber sky.  
And I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Sail on, sail away.  
May all your dreams come true one day.  
Sail on, sail away.

But the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong,  
Between her fine perfume and angel face,  
My whole world became another place.  
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong,  
Soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong.  
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door.  
I could not wait to hear the siren song,  
The beginning of the end of my happy home.  
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, oooh, hooo,  
too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Heard them say the payback's double-fold,  
Just can't seem to remember who I bought and sold.  
I'll probably still be here when you come around next year,  
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole.  
I'll be damned if I just don't feel I'm growin' old.  
Sailing, sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo,  
Too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Cause she was eviler than evil, slippery like a fox,  
set me up with pain and woe and, I swear it won't seem to stop.  
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul,  
Swear I'll leave and not come back, just let me out that door.  
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo,  
Too blind in love, too blind to see.

Didn't take the time to see

Shame is washed away  
When we're all one, life is but a dream, life is but a dream

Fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac  
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest  
And a queer threw up at the sight of that

Drinking milkshakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine

Alphaville,Giants,/a/alphaville/giants_20206860.html,"Be on your guard when you sit in the open places  
because I'm blessed with all the wonders of the sun  
when tigers, palmtrees, rattlesnakes unfold their graces  
that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from  
and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways  
and angels burn to dust before the human race  
we're giants under a rainbow  
we're stranded east of eden  
Sometimes we're crying in the afterglow  
in a world of broken toys, how can we live without them  
freedom that is what you are always screaming  
it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh  
those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming  
I'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
but there's no devil in the darkness, no demon in the skies  
nothing to be afraid of, cross my heart and hope to die  
freedom...  
Freedom...

I wish I'd touched your face  
And you would hold my hand  
Then tears were on our guard  
And silence was our friend  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
I dreamt I had the time to listen what you'd say  
And what you'd say was true and we could start anew  
I saw u bachstage in that chair  
Dressed up in lies but oh so fair  
And then I took you by the hand and off we went  
And we just drank to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too but it wouldn't do  
And all the poems that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations

The sound of the traffic  
Is like a silent dream  
  
The dust in the park  
The exhaust from the cars  
Ascends in that heated afternoon  
(You touch a sweaty body!)  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The day feels so tired  
From the lead in the air  
And the fire in the skies  
  
Life seemed to be a fault of grace  
But it's ok  
It gave you a kiss  
In the middle of the crossroads  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The heat of the sun  
Which is stored in the pavement  
Feels so fine  
  
Here stands the innocent  
And there it comes oh so wild  
That's when you're longing  
For a summer by the wall  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
Summer in Berlin, it's ok

This is a national anthem  
From the flip-side of the empire  
Hand on my heart  
Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radio-beacon  
That's sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards  
Hey, tell me it's true  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face,  
Do I still walk on the same structure?  
Hey, what do we know  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru' a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Can't understand what you say  
But I think that you're calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In real-time-precision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey, tell me it's true,  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure?  
Hey, what do we know,  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Everybody walks this side of the run-way  
Everybody hopes to get off the trap  
All we really like is to groove with emotion  
Waiting for the airline to lift us up...

Just one direction in my thoughts

It can be a game  
Sometimes it's tragic  
And sometimes a shame  
Words were my bullets  
Emotion my gun  
I was a runner  
Now I'm on the run  
Sometimes I wish that you were dead  
That is because you haunt me so  
I wasn't right to let you go away  
I try to kill the pain inside  
But you are always on my mind  
No matter where I go or stay  
Sometimes I dream my time away  
And we're together again  
But I know that can never be  
And all my hopes are in vain  
You were my treasure  
That I didn't know  
You were the sun in my life  
Thought I was dying  
When I realized  
There's just one chance to survive.

America,A Horse With No Name,/a/america/a+horse+with+no+name_20007105.html,"On the first part of the journey  
I was looking at all the life  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz  
And the sky with no clouds  
The heat was hot and the ground was dry  
But the air was full of sound  
  
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After two days in the desert sun  
My skin began to turn red  
After three days in the desert fun  
I was looking at a river bed  
And the story it told of a river that flowed  
Made me sad to think it was dead  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After nine days I let the horse run free  
Cause the desert had turned to sea  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground  
And a perfect disguise above  
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground  
But the humans will give no love

Over the banks, 'cross the emerald lawn

America,My Dear,/a/america/my+dear_20007277.html,"Here in the dawn  
As I walk through this dream  
As I have done since ages now gone  
Shall I read you the letter  
They sent postmarked from somewhere out here  
It's in Latin, I think, I don't know  
Can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Near to their bed (they never sleep)  
They sit sipping their tea, watch the sea  
Move the sand through their heads (sit in their chairs by the bay)  
Did I show you the marks on the wall  
Left by captains now dead (house out on the cove)  
They fell fighting for peace in their lives  
Or so it is said (still nobody seems to be here)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
You can't miss it  
A blue forest on a green sky  
You must risk it  
Don't ignore us if you want us to  
If we want us to survive  
Where will I be (can't you help me to find my way)  
After watching them walking the pier  
At the mouth of the sea (I've been lost for so long)  
They're in love with the news  
And don't show if they're living in fear (still nobody seems to be here)  
They eat ice cream alone  
Watch the waves at the end of the pier (ah, nobody seems to hear)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear

I've been in love, girl, so many times before  
They'd love me and leave me, i thought i knew the score  
I'd fall in love no more  
I was walking in shadows then, my life a lonely road  
I was walking to nowhere, with a heavy loaded heart

And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
The longer together then, the more we fell in love  
No makin' or breakin' up, now i know i found real love  
And i can't get enough (oo, i love you, i really love you)  
So good to be winnin' now, i never thought i'd do  
You got me spinnin', honey it's all down to you  
You're there to see me through (oo, i love you, i really love you, yes i love
you)  
  
(do, do, do ... ) and from just one kiss  
Who would believe that it would be like this

My baby slept, the sky was blue  
I started walkin' thinkin' only of you  
Up the hill and down the road  
Past the people that I barely know  
Round the bend to the run-off wash  
I found a feather that a quail had lost  
Where are you goin' now my friend  
Where are you goin' now  
Are you going to see them on the mountain now  
Goin' to see them trees  
Goin' to watch the circles take a bow  
Goin' to help agree  
To be  
Today  
Some people like to play out loud  
I like them always, they're a laughing crowd  
To catch the wind then come slidin' down  
You reach the bottom fallin' upside down  
Touch a hand and see the world turnin' circles  
Brushin' every curl back again  
To those sunset walks  
That special summer and those all night talks

It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed  
Ford slowin' down to take a look at me  
Come on, baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me  
We may lose and we may win though  
We will never be here again  
So open up, I'm climbin' in,  
So take it easy  
Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen  
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind  
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my  
Cover, she's so hard to find  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own  
Wheels make you crazy  
Come on baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me, oh oh oh  
Oh we got it easy  
We oughta take it easy

America,The Border,/a/america/the+border_20007281.html,"You must be lost in a faraway land  
I searched forever your footprints in the sand  
I feel you need me, I have to answer  
That desperate call that I do not understand  
  
A burning bridge, a lonely highway  
Another dark night thinking alone  
What could've happened, am I just dreaming  
It doesn't matter but there's one thing that I know  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
So on and on I keep on running  
To make the border before the light  
Just one more river, then I can make it  
Again you'll be in my arms tonight  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border ...

America,Town And Country,/a/america/town+country_20007219.html,"Touched by a butterfly on my way home  
Flying who knows where  
Walking down that dusty road  
Without a care  
The sun was shining up in the country  
And bells were ringing downtown  
Clouds were moving slow and lazy  
While I was kicking around  
And feeling out the town and the country  
Feeling out the town and the country  
Up on the hill I got a better look  
I watched the river run brown (watched the river run brown)  
And then I heard those songbirds singing  
The country sound  
When I got home I sat in my kitchen  
And turned the television on (turned the TV on)  
The news wasn't good so I didn't listen  
I started clicking around  
Thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country  
Thinking of the town and the country  
In the morning everything will be the same  
Open up your world (watch the children play)  
In the sun or rain  
Thinking of the town and the country  
A thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country (fade)

A little fingernail polish, chewin' gum  
Her round the world heart made of platinum, that's right  
She looks like a China doll baby, especially in white  
A tropicana flower in the candlelight  
She turned into a pumpkin pie, sweet kiss at midnight  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
She wants to be your red-hot mama, all alone  
She dances with the boys on the telephone  
She makes a lotta noise in the quiet zone at night  
Yeah, you talk about a party at the beach, ain't that grand  
She just took a raincheck with another man  
Who lay on the deck of his catamaran some night  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
Well, I can't tell you much, but what I know (what I know)  
You can't take her with you when it's time to go  
'Cause she knows where it's at with a Romeo, you'll see  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love

A chill is in the air  
And carols everywhere  
Close your eyes, it's almost here  
Candles and cards  
And favorite movie scenes  
The smell of evergreen  
As special as it's always been  
And I have a dream or two  
Maybe they will come true  
  
[Chorus:]  
Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight  
We'll wake up to a world of white  
It's gonna be a christmas to remember  
Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole  
Always sentimental and don't you know that  
It's gonna be a Christmas to remember  
  
I know it's true  
Time doesn't stand still  
Many things can change  
But we know some things never will  
The memories we share  
The songs we always sing  
The mystery of life  
The hopefulness this season brings  
And I have a dream or two  
Maybe they will come true

The darkenss deepens, Lord, with me abide  
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me  
  
I need Thy presence every passing hour  
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?  
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  
Through cloud and sunshine, o abide with me  
  
Abide, with me  
Abide, abide with me  
  
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, Thy victory?  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me

Abide, abide with me

After the smoke is blown away

After the stillness finds you  
After the winds of change  
All that is good and true between us  
This will remain the same  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ashes cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
After your time of wondering  
Along this lonely road  
There will be many voices calling  
Mine will say welcome home  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ash is cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
I will be here for you

Amy Grant,Ageless Medley,/a/amy+grant/ageless+medley_20007735.html,"Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
Listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
Too late for walking in the middle,  
Too late to try.  
And it's too late for sitting in the balance,  
No more middle line.  
  
Are you puzzled by the way that you're behaving?  
You wonder why you do the things you do?  
Are you troubled by your lack of resistance?  
It feels like something's got a hold on you.  
  
Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
When I'm losing my sense of direction,  
And I'm needing some strength and protection,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You, and when I,  
When I think I can't stand any longer,  
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
El-Elyon na Adonai,  
Age to age, You're still the same,  
By the power of the name.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
Erkamka na Adonai,  
I will praise and lift You high,  
El Shaddai.  
  
I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly.  
I'm lighter than air.  
  
And I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly,  
And soar through the air.  
  
'Cause I have felt for the first time,  
I can be myself,  
No more faces to hide behind,  
Just a smile,  
And a dream that's mine.  
Even if I am  
The only one,  
Who wants to fly....  
  
I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl,  
And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world.  
But that's all right, as long as I can have one wish I pray:  
When people look inside my life, I want to hear them say,  
  
She's got her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes, ya know.  
Just like my father's eyes.... (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing....  
  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing!  
You know you really gotta sii-hii-yiing!  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing! (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
I have decided,  
I'm gonna live like I believer,  
Turn my back on the deceiver.  
I'm gonna live what I believe.  
I have decided,  
Being good is just a fable,  
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.  
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing.

Then you gently re-remind me  
That You've made me from the first  
And the more I try to be the best  
The more I get the worst.  
And I realize the good in me is only there because of who  
You are, who You are.  
And all I ever have to be is what  
You've made me

As you daily recreate me help me always keep in mind

And trim it to the top  
And spend a whole lot more

To live with Thee there  
Take us to Heaven
